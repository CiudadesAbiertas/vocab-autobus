# Bus vocabulary

This vocabulary is being developed in the context of the open data action of the project [Open, Collaborative and Interoperable Government Platform](http://www.red.es/redes/es/que-hacemos/ciudades-inteligentes/proyectos-en-ciudades), of the [II Call for Smart Cities](https://perfilcontratante.red.es/perfilcontratante/busqueda/DetalleLicitacionesDefault.action?idLicitacion=6707&visualizar=0) of the [Ministry of Economy](http://www.mineco.gob.es/) and Company launched through the [Public Business Entity Red.es](http://www.red.es/) attached to the [Secretary of State for Digital Advancement of said Ministry](http://www.mineco.gob.es/portal/site/mineco/avancedigital).


## Purpose and scope of the vocabulary

The purpose of this vocabulary is to describe in a semantic way the public services of regular terrestrial transport of people by road that are carried out with buses and that are provided by the municipal corporations in such a way that the institution itself, the city council, the citizenship or third parties can know in a standard, open and simple way the essential issues of its operation, as it was established in the scope of the vocabulary.

In the same agreement, we limit working with information referring to public bus transport systems, "urban buses", so we leave out other urban public transport systems such as the tramway, the subway, the funicular, the gondola, the trolleybus or any other means of public or private transport in the city or that has stops in the city but has an extra-urban component such as intercity or private buses.

From the public bus transport systems we will focus on two types of information: static and dynamic.
* Static information, referring to lines, stops, routes, timetables and planned incidents.
* Dynamic information, referring to bus arrival time at stops and unplanned incidents.

Having data on the transport of people that occurs in cities is a very valuable element for municipalities, citizens and third parties, whether for the management of services, the use of services or the provision of services by third parties in different areas such as traffic management, the design of road infrastructure, compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals, air quality, urban mobility, MaaS or any other related area.
